# Algorithms Lab - HS2021
In this course students learn how to solve algorithmic problems given by a textual, story-like description. We assume knowledge of elementary algorithms and data structures as they are typically taught on the Bachelor level. In tutorials we introduce more advanced algorithms and the usage of some standard libraries for combinatorial algorithms. Students practice their skills by solving weekly exercises. For that they have to understand the problem setting, find an appropriate modeling, choose suitable algorithms, and implement them using C/C++, BGL, and CGAL. The evaluation of the correctness and efficiency of their solutions will be performed by an online-judge which compiles the submitted source-code and runs it on a set of test instances.
