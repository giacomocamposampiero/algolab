## Real Estate
Simple problem to understand how to use min cost max flow with BGL. The problem can be modeled as a min cost max flow with positive weights considering as cost the maximum possible bid minus the actual bid for each bidding edge. The other constraints defined by the problem (e.g. max number of sold properties per stata, max number of sites that a bidder can buy) can on the other hand be modeled using edge capacities.
