## Dominoes
In this problem, you are dealing with a special kind of domino set, in which the tiles are of different heights. Your task is to determine, given an arrangement of these tiles in a line, how many of the domino tiles will fall after toppling the left-most domino.

More precisely, we have the following set-up: the dominoes are placed at successive points on the integer line, the first at position 1, the second at 2, and so on. If a tile of height h at position i is toppled, this causes the tiles at all positions j > i such that j âˆ’ i < h to fall as well.
