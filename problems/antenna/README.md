## Antenna
Yet another easy problem to practice with CGAL. In this case, using EPEC with sqrt was unavoidable, but it's fine since the solution passes all of the tests. 
Note that the problem could be easily solved starting from the template [miniball.cpp](https://algolab.inf.ethz.ch/doc/tutorials/sample_code/tut03_miniball.cpp).
