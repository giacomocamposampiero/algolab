## Inball
Yet another LP problem. The difficulty of this problem is really more geometric than purely algorithmic. Indeed, once you get the geometric formulation of the problem, writing the corresponding LP formulation is rather easy. For the detail geometric solution of the problem, please refer to the official solutions from course lecturers (available [here](https://github.com/daniCh8/eth-algolab-2019/blob/master/week7/inball/master-solution-inball.pdf) for example).
