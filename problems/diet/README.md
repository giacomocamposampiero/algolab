## Diet
Diet is a classical optimization problem, where constraints are defined on nutrients that every food has and we are required to find the optimal assignment to the quantity of each food such that the cost of the diet is minimized and the constraints on the nutrients are satisfied. In this problem constraints and variables are no longer explicit, but it's not too difficult to understand that the variables are the quantity of each food in the diet, the constraints are given by the nutrient
quantities and the objective function is the sum of the product between each aliment cost and the quantity we pick for that aliment.
