Since the path from the entrance to each chamber of the underground network is unique, we're clearly dealing with a tree. The problem is to find the best visiting order of the tree, which corresponds (at least for the first 90 points) to visiting the cheaper subtrees to reach first. In fact, leaving the most expensive nodes at the end of the visit allows us to save the gold that would have been otherwise consumed during the travel upwards.
